Unlike other ngo?s we do not want to look at just one thing as our agenda instead cater to all needs across. It could be flood relief, under privilege kids, helping old age people or anything. There are a lot of ngos across the country who cater to different needs of the society and some for all. We are not here to create one more ngo that just cares at one set of social issues, we want to have no boundaries in what we can do. Lets look at some initiatives that we are planning for now. There are hundreds of ngos who are the home for orphans and hundreds of old age homes thats available across the country. So we went into understanding what both of these are missing and found out that they are missing each other. So we have come up with an idea of bringing them together."]},
